<h3>Biography</h3>
<br>

    <p>Where to begin?  The beginning is always a good starting place.  A long time ago, in a doctor's office in this very state, Saundra Karyn Clark, now AKA Kacy, was born.  "How long ago?" you ask.  See the next paragraph for a clue.  This state is known as the bluegrass state, the Derby state - the great state of Kentucky.  I was raised in Chicago.</p>
<br>
<p>I am a <i>VietNam war veteran</i>.  I was enlisted and served with the Army Security Agency as a Chinese Mandarin linguist.  I looked around and noticed the enlisted folks did all the work and made about a 1/4<sup>th</sup> of their supervisors' pay.  I felt a change coming.  I went <strong>back to college</strong> and became a Registered Nurse, giving up my dream to be a veterinarian.  I wanted to go back into the military as an officer.  I spent a total of 31 years on active duty and in reserves.  I was a critical care nurse for 40 years.</p>
<br>
<p> I retired four years ago from nursing and have decided I need more income so I can pay off my house, have it demolished, and build a bunker into the hill where my house sits now.  <b>Voila`!</b>  I am now a fellow classmate of yours in this short and fast-paced course.  Please feel free to help <em>this Granny</em> any time you are able.  ;>)</p>
<br>
<p>On the lighter side, I have two sons, and five grand-children; 23 guineas, 6 roosters and 30 hens <mark>in the barn</mark>, 5 female cats and 14 kittens, 2 baby geese and 39 baby chickens <mark>in the house</mark>.  Until just a few months ago, I also had 110 - <ins>yep, you read that right, 110 </ins> - chihuahuas (all in the house).  I'm gearing up to buy big dogs (and probably a couple or three more tiny chis).  I sure wanted to be a vet!  Thanks for reading<small> and hope you got a faint smile from reading this bio.</small></p>
